# GPIO Lesson 1


## Lab1
- On **STM32F103XX** 
    + Pin A1 have a single pressing button that controls a LED on pin B1 
    + Pin A13 have a multi pressing button that controls a LED on pin B13


## Lab2
- On **Atmega32**
    + Port A have 8 Leds
    + Turn them on in a sequential way  
    + Then turn them off in a sequential way


## Lab3
- On **Atmega32**
    + Port A have 8 Leds
    + Port B pin 0,1 have 2 buttons
    + By each press on button 0 turn the next led on 
    + By each press on button 1 turn the previous led off


## Lab4
- On **Atmega32** without using avr/io.h and util/delay.h
    + Port D pin 5,6,7 as output (LED)
    + Port D pin 4 (Buzzer) 
    + Write A embedded C Code To toggle 3 Led on sequential way
    + Then start a tick(pulse) by Buzzer then Return again
